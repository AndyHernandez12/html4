		<h1>Continued delay as Ask-Man creator struggles with procrastination!</h1>
		</header>
		
			<p class="solid">The creator himself has been having issues turning in homework in on time. When questioned as to why, his answer was straight forward, "Yeah it's all my fault. I'm to blame. I've been procrastinating lately and it's putting me behind schedule for future projects. I also feel guilty due to the fact that Mrs. Escobar is such an exceptional professor, she deserves a good student and, frankly, I haven't been that good".
		
			However, as of today Februrary 28th, 2020, Andy has increased his productivity 10-fold compared to last week. The assignments, which were due 3 days ago, are being completed. Once he finishes HTML4/CSS assignment, he will submit the website project and soon begin his future assignments to catch up on work.
